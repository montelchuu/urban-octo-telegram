# Week 1 Challenge

## Changes made

Changing divs to semantic html. When changing the divs, I made sure the changes in html matched the changes in css. ie. header div to header nav

Deleted redundant lines in css by changing classes in the content and benefits section. After changing the classes in the articles, I deleted the extra css elements.
